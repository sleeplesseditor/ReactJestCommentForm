# ReactJestCommentForm

A demonstration on the use of Jest and Enzyme with React (as well as custom middleware), via a simple comment form app. There is a particular focus on unit testing, though it does contain an example of integration testing as well (the tests require some minor updates following the implementation of higher order components and middleware).

The app use the JSON Placeholder API to provide dummy text for the list of comments.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
